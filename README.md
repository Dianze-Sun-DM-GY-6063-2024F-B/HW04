Project Title
HW04A: Dynamic Circular Grid
Design Process
In this project, I started by creating a series of circular shapes arranged in a grid pattern. I aimed to make these circles gradually decrease in size as they approached the center point. To achieve this, I researched the dist() and map() functions to calculate the distance from each circle to the center and adjust their sizes accordingly. Additionally, I introduced random positioning and color variations to make the circles appear more vibrant and lively.

HW04B: Subtle Line Expressions
Design Process
For this project, I wanted to interpret the concept of straight lines in a more subtle manner. I used the line function to draw a series of gently bended lines, introducing some randomness at each bend point. This approach added a sense of liveliness and dynamism to the lines, enhancing their visual appeal.
